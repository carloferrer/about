# about
It's my resume!  You're free to peruse the source code, though you can [check out the resultant resume here](https://carloferrer.github.io/about).

## Setup
- Clone this repository.
- `cd` to repository root.
- Install with `yarn`.
  - If you don't have Yarn, install that first.  In my use cases for `npm`, Yarn is more performant.
  - Otherwise, you could probably use `npm`, though I haven't tested this repo with it.

## Running the Project
- `yarn start` (or if you prefer, `npm run start`) to start local server.
- `yarn deploy` (or if you prefer, `npm run deploy`) to deploy to GitHub Pages.

## Stack
- React
- SCSS
- GitHub Pages
- gh-pages (a package that deploys React applications to GitHub Pages)
